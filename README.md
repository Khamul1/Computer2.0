# Computer2.0

I am studying in Java-begin courses

Implement the operation of the computer and monitor.

Entities:

1) Computer:
– property “name": name – String
– property “Monitor": connected monitor (variable-reference to Monitor)
– “on" method: turn on the computer
– "off" method: turn off the computer

2) Monitor:
– property “name": name

When turning on the computer:
output to the console: “The computer turned on (turned off) name, the name monitor is used “
interfaces should be created for Computer and Monitor, because these are the main objects of business processes
